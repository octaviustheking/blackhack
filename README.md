## How to play
At the beginning of every round, you have a chance to visit a shady man. This is the shop. However, it can only be accessed if your balance is over 1500.

You will then have a chance to place your bet. Place your bet, and the game will start.

You will be dealt 2 cards. Face cards are worth 10, and Aces are worth either 1 or 11. 

You will then be prompted to hit, stand, or inventory. Hitting will give you another card. Standing will mean you are done, and the dealer will take his turn. Typing inventory will open your inventory.

If you want to use an item in your inventory, simply type its name as shown. 

When it is the dealer's turn, he will first pull 2 cards. If the amount is 16 or lower, he will hit. Otherwise, he will stand.

Any ties are always a dealer win.

Reaching $0 will end the game.

## Items, and what they do
1. A gun
 - This shoots the dealer dead, allowing you to pocket the $1000 in his wallet. However, this move automatically ends the game, so only use it when you're done playing.
2. A fake face
 - This gives you a fake face card (Jack, Queen, or King), and allows you to sneak it into your hand to give you +10.
3. A face ace
 - Similar to the fake face, you can sneak a fake ace in to either get +11 or +1.
4. Portable Incinerator
 - This item burns your most recent card.

## Combos
Combos are moves of using different inventory items to give you an edge. 
1. Incinerator-Face Combo ($700)
 - If you have an Ace as your first card, use your incinerator to burn the other card. Then, sneak in your fake face card to get 21.
2. Incinerator-Ace Combo ($900)
 - If you have a card that is worth 10 (10, J, Q, K), incinerate your other card and use your fake ace to get 21.
